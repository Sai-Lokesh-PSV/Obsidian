## Introduction to Calculus

### What is Calculus?
- The study of continuous change
- Developed independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century
- Two main branches: Differential Calculus and Integral Calculus

### Course Overview
1. Limits and Continuity
2. Derivatives
3. Applications of Derivatives
4. Integrals
5. Applications of Integrals

## Fundamental Concepts

### Functions
- Review of function notation: f(x)
- Domain and range
- Types of functions: linear, quadratic, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric

### Limits
- Intuitive understanding of limits
- Notation: lim(x→a) f(x) = L
- One-sided limits
- Limit laws (to be covered in detail later)

### Continuity
- Definition of continuity
- Conditions for continuity:
  1. f(a) is defined
  2. lim(x→a) f(x) exists
  3. lim(x→a) f(x) = f(a)

## Preview of Derivatives

### The Tangent Line Problem
- Slope of a curve at a point
- Average rate of change vs. instantaneous rate of change

### The Derivative
- Definition as a limit
- Notation: f'(x), dy/dx
- Interpretation as rate of change

## Homework
1. Review basic algebra and trigonometry concepts
2. Read Chapter 1 in the textbook
3. Solve problems 1-10 at the end of Chapter 1

## Next Class
We will dive deeper into limits and begin exploring techniques for evaluating limits.
