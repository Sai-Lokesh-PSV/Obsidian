Nick Milo is the creator of the Linking Your Thinking (LYT) system and workshop. His philosophy centers on the idea that our notemaking should be as interconnected and fluid as our thoughts. 

The LYT approach emphasizes creating a flexible, non-hierarchical system of linked notes that can adapt to our evolving understanding. 

Milo advocates for balancing structure and chaos in notemaking, using tools like MOCs (Maps of Content) to navigate and make sense of our personal knowledge databases.
