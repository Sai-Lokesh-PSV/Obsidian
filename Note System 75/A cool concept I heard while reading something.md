# Antifragility

Antifragility is a property of systems that increase in capability, resilience, or robustness as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures. It's a concept introduced by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book "Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder".

## Key Points:
- Goes beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.
- Examples in nature: Human bones and muscles that get stronger when subjected to stress and tension.
- Applies to systems, institutions, and aspects of culture that evolve under pressure.

## Implications:
- In personal development: Embracing challenges leads to growth.
- In business: Companies that adapt and innovate during crises often emerge stronger.
- In society: Some social systems become stronger when tested by upheaval.

## Questions to Consider:
- How can we design systems to be antifragile?
- What areas of life or society would benefit from more antifragility?
- Are there downsides to antifragility in certain contexts?
