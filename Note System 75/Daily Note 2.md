Called Mom. She's planning a trip to Greece next month.

Lunch with Alex. Discussed his new project on [[Renewable Energy]]. Fascinating stuff about solar panel efficiency.

Evening: Tried new recipe for vegetarian chili. Needs more spice next time.

Idea: Start a weekly recipe experimentation night?
