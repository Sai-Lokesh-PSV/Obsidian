# Highlights from a third book I was reading

Book: "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari

- Cognitive Revolution and its role in human dominance
- Agriculture as history's biggest fraud
- The unification of humankind through empires and religion

Reflect: How does this macro view of history affect my understanding of current global issues?
