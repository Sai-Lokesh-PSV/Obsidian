## Reactions of Alkenes

### Electrophilic Addition Reactions
1. Hydrohalogenation
   - Markovnikov's rule
   - Carbocation stability: 3° > 2° > 1° > CH₃⁺
2. Hydration
   - Acid-catalyzed
   - Oxymercuration-demercuration
3. Halogenation
   - Mechanism: formation of halonium ion intermediate
4. Halohydrin formation

### Free Radical Addition
- Anti-Markovnikov addition of HBr
- Mechanism and initiators

### Oxidation Reactions
1. Epoxidation
2. Dihydroxylation
3. Ozonolysis
   - Mechanism
   - Synthetic utility

### Reduction
- Catalytic hydrogenation

## Alkynes: Structure and Reactivity

### Structure and Bonding
- sp hybridization
- Linear geometry

### Nomenclature
- IUPAC system for alkynes

### Acidity of Terminal Alkynes
- Formation of acetylide ions

### Reactions of Alkynes
1. Addition reactions (similar to alkenes)
2. Hydration (Kucherov reaction)
3. Reduction to alkenes or alkanes

## Introduction to Reaction Mechanisms

### Arrow Pushing
- Representing electron movement
- Curved arrow notation

### Types of Mechanisms
1. Ionic (heterolytic)
2. Radical (homolytic)

### Steps in Writing Mechanisms
1. Identify reactants, products, and reaction conditions
2. Determine electron-rich and electron-poor species
3. Use curved arrows to show electron movement
4. Balance charges and show resonance if applicable

## Homework
1. Read Chapters 4 and 5 in the textbook
2. Practice problems: Predict products of various alkene and alkyne reactions
3. Mechanism exercise: Write the complete mechanism for the acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene

## Next Class
We will begin our study of alcohols, focusing on their structure, properties, and synthesis.
