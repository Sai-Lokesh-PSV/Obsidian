# Highlights from another book I was reading

Book: "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman

- System 1 (fast, intuitive) vs System 2 (slow, deliberate) thinking
- Anchoring effect in decision making
- Availability heuristic and its impact on risk assessment

Question: How can I apply these concepts to improve my daily decision-making?
