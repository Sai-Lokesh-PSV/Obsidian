LYT differs from traditional note-taking methods in its emphasis on linking and active engagement with notes. While traditional methods often rely on hierarchical structures (like folders) or chronological ordering, LYT encourages a more fluid, network-based approach. LYT uses bidirectional linking, allowing ideas to be connected in multiple ways. It also emphasizes ongoing refinement and restructuring of notes, treating them as evolving thoughts rather than static information. This approach aims to mirror the non-linear nature of human thinking more closely than traditional methods.
