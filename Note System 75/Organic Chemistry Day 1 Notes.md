## Introduction to Organic Chemistry

### What is Organic Chemistry?
- Study of compounds containing carbon
- Exceptions: CO₂, carbonates, cyanides, etc.

### Importance of Organic Chemistry
1. Biochemistry and life processes
2. Pharmaceuticals
3. Materials science
4. Energy and fuels
5. Environmental science

## Carbon: The Central Element

### Properties of Carbon
- Atomic number: 6
- Electron configuration: 1s² 2s² 2p²
- Ability to form 4 covalent bonds

### Hybridization
1. sp³ hybridization (tetrahedral)
2. sp² hybridization (trigonal planar)
3. sp hybridization (linear)

## Basic Concepts in Organic Chemistry

### Structural Formulas
- Lewis structures
- Condensed structural formulas
- Bond-line structures (skeletal formulas)

### Functional Groups
- Definition: Specific arrangement of atoms within molecules
- Importance in reactivity and properties
- Examples: alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids

### Isomerism
1. Structural isomers
2. Stereoisomers (introduced, to be covered in detail later)

## Alkanes: The Simplest Organic Compounds

### Definition and General Formula
- CnH2n+2

### Nomenclature
- IUPAC system
- Prefixes for carbon chain length
- Numbering and naming branches

### Physical Properties
- Boiling points
- Solubility

### Conformations
- Newman projections
- Eclipsed vs. staggered conformations

## Homework
1. Read Chapter 1 in the textbook
2. Practice drawing structural formulas for simple organic compounds
3. Nomenclature exercises: Name 10 given alkanes

## Next Class
We will delve deeper into alkanes, discussing their reactions and more complex naming scenarios.
