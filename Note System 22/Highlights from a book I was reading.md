Moby Dick - Herman Melville

"Call me Ishmael." - iconic opening line, sets tone for whole story

Queequeg - harpooner, Ishmael's friend. Tattooed, pagan. Friendship across cultures?

"I try all things, I achieve what I can." - Ishmael's philosophy. Relates to [[Perseverance]]?

Ahab's obsession with the white whale - madness or determination? "All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks." - Ahab sees deeper meaning in everything

"For there is no folly of the beast of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men." - commentary on human nature vs animal nature

Q: How does the symbolism of the white whale change throughout the novel?

Note to self: Look up whaling industry in 19th century for context

Thoughts: Themes of fate, free will, obsession. Epic scale but also intimate character study.
