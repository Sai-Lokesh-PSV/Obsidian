## Limits in Depth

### Review of Limit Definition
- Informal definition: The value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value
- Notation: lim(x→a) f(x) = L

### Techniques for Evaluating Limits

1. Direct Substitution
   - When the function is continuous at the point of interest
   - Example: lim(x→2) (x^2 + 3x - 1)

2. Factoring
   - Useful when direct substitution results in 0/0
   - Example: lim(x→3) (x^2 - 9) / (x - 3)

3. Rationalization
   - Used for limits involving radicals
   - Example: lim(x→4) (√x - 2) / (x - 4)

4. Using Special Limits
   - lim(x→0) (sin x) / x = 1
   - lim(x→∞) (1 + 1/x)^x = e

### One-Sided Limits
- Left-hand limit: lim(x→a^-) f(x)
- Right-hand limit: lim(x→a^+) f(x)
- A limit exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal

### Infinite Limits and Limits at Infinity
- Vertical asymptotes: lim(x→a) f(x) = ±∞
- Horizontal asymptotes: lim(x→±∞) f(x) = L

### Limit Laws
1. Sum/Difference Law: lim[f(x) ± g(x)] = lim f(x) ± lim g(x)
2. Product Law: lim[f(x) · g(x)] = lim f(x) · lim g(x)
3. Quotient Law: lim[f(x) / g(x)] = lim f(x) / lim g(x), if lim g(x) ≠ 0
4. Power Law: lim[f(x)]^n = [lim f(x)]^n
5. Root Law: lim √f(x) = √(lim f(x)), if lim f(x) ≥ 0

## Introduction to Continuity

### Definition of Continuity at a Point
A function f(x) is continuous at x = a if:
1. f(a) is defined
2. lim(x→a) f(x) exists
3. lim(x→a) f(x) = f(a)

### Types of Discontinuities
1. Removable discontinuity (point discontinuity)
2. Jump discontinuity
3. Infinite discontinuity

## Homework
1. Read Chapter 2 in the textbook
2. Solve problems 1-15 at the end of Chapter 2
3. Practice evaluating limits using various techniques

## Next Class
We will conclude our discussion on continuity and begin introducing the concept of derivatives.
