## Introduction to Derivatives

### The Concept of Rate of Change
- Average rate of change
- Instantaneous rate of change

### The Derivative as a Limit
- Definition: f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h
- Alternate notation: dy/dx

### Geometric Interpretation of the Derivative
- Slope of the tangent line at a point
- Relationship to secant lines

## Differentiation Rules

### Basic Differentiation Rules
1. Constant Rule: d/dx (c) = 0, where c is a constant
2. Power Rule: d/dx (x^n) = n·x^(n-1)
3. Constant Multiple Rule: d/dx [c·f(x)] = c·f'(x)

### Sum and Difference Rules
- d/dx [f(x) ± g(x)] = f'(x) ± g'(x)

### Product Rule
- d/dx [f(x)·g(x)] = f'(x)·g(x) + f(x)·g'(x)

### Quotient Rule
- d/dx [f(x)/g(x)] = [f'(x)·g(x) - f(x)·g'(x)] / [g(x)]^2

## Examples of Derivative Calculations
1. f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5
2. g(x) = (x^2 + 1) / (x - 2)
3. h(x) = x^3 · (2x + 1)

## Applications of Derivatives

### Tangent Line Equations
- Point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1)
- Slope (m) is the derivative at the point

### Motion Problems
- Position function: s(t)
- Velocity: v(t) = s'(t)
- Acceleration: a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t)

## Introduction to the Chain Rule (Preview)
- Used for compositive functions
- d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) · g'(x)

## Homework
1. Read Chapter 3 in the textbook
2. Solve problems 1-20 at the end of Chapter 3
3. Practice applying differentiation rules to various functions

## Next Class
We will explore the Chain Rule in depth and begin looking at applications of derivatives.
