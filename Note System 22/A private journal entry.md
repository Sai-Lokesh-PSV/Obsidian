Dear Journal,

Today was a rollercoaster. Woke up feeling anxious about the upcoming presentation at work. The fear of public speaking never seems to go away entirely, no matter how many times I do it. Spent the morning rehearsing, trying to calm my nerves.

The presentation went better than expected. Sarah from Marketing gave me a thumbs up afterwards, which meant a lot. Still, I can't shake this feeling that I could have done better. Why am I always so hard on myself?

Had lunch alone. Wanted some time to decompress. Thought about calling Mom but didn't feel up to putting on a cheerful voice. Sometimes I wonder if she notices when I'm not being completely honest about how I'm feeling.

Got an email from Alex in the evening. He's going through with the divorce. Feel terrible for him, but also a bit envious of his courage to make such a big change. It's making me think about my own relationship. Are J and I just comfortable, or truly happy? Need to reflect on this more.

Skipped the gym. Feeling guilty about it, but just couldn't muster the energy. Ended up reading more of "Moby Dick" instead. Finding myself relating to Ishmael's desire to escape. Sometimes I fantasize about just packing up and going on an adventure. Is that normal at my age?

Tomorrow's a new day. Hoping to wake up with a fresher perspective. Need to remember to be kinder to myself.

Thought of the day: Is contentment enough, or should we always strive for happiness?
