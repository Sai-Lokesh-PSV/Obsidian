Woke up early. 30 min meditation - felt more focused all day.

Work: Started new project on AI ethics. Need to research more about [[Bias in Machine Learning]].

Evening: Community meeting about new park development. Lots of debate about location.

Reflection: How do we balance progress and preservation in urban development?

Note to self: Look up local history of park spaces.
