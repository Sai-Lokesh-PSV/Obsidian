Try to work with few examples. As far as possible, start documentation and clearly write source, source code or copy source code in the doc or copy API with its hyperlinks using Obsidian (create one for sumana@etaxmentor.com and give access to nagaraju@etaxmentor.com). All the very best for your first intern project!
