# Computer Vision and Cloud
these are some of the basics that has been prevalent in every sector of tech

## introduction

image processing and cloud computing

### What is computer vision

- identifying objects and people to computer language.
- used in defense,surveillance

### what is cloud computing
to compute much larger storage of programs that require more than i7 and i9 processors

## Python basics

the IDE does not matter, these are some of the different ways companies promote their products. Anaconda 



- Importing and Exporting
- Libraries and Dependencies

functional issues and securities issues are some of the major problems

### Anoconda Environment
Environment > new > and fill in the details
using a Jupiter notebook

### Lists
```python
list1 = list()
list2 = []

list1 == list2
// True
```
these are some of the ways we can define lists
they are 2 independent functions, their id's generated by the computer are different for each

```python
list1.append(0)
list1.append(1)
list2.append(2)
print(list1)
print(list2)

list1 += list2
print(list1)
print(list2)
```

### Loops
```python
n = 5000
list3 = []
for i in range(5):
	if i == n -1:
		list3.append(i)
	else:
		print(i)
```
### Functions
gengeration of random variables
```python
import random
def func(n):
	n1 = randm.randrange(0, 1000)
	return [n1, n1 * n]

func1(50)
```
