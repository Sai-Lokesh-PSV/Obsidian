**Establish Boundaries:** Clearly state your own actions and limits without demanding changes from the other person, which avoids power struggles and sets a respectful tone.

**Non-Engagement:** Use techniques like saying "okay" with a friendly tone or responding slowly and sincerely to deflate rude behavior by not giving it the reaction it seeks.

**Ask Open Questions:** Use open-ended questions to genuinely understand the rude person's perspective, avoiding closed questions that can feel like traps and provoke defensiveness.

**Avoid Debates:** Explicitly state that you don’t want to debate and, if necessary, share your opinions directly rather than disguising them as questions to prevent escalating the rudeness.

**Seek Permission to Share:** Before sharing your perspective, ask if it’s okay with the other person, which helps reduce their defensiveness and makes them more receptive to your views.
