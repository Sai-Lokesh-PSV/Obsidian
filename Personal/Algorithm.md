**Definition of algorithm**: An algorithm is a finite set of instructions which, if followed, accomplish a particular task. 
In addition every algorithm must satisfy the following criteria:

1. input: there are zero or more quantities which are externally supplied;
2. output: at least one quantity is produced;
3. definiteness: each instruction must be clear and unambiguous;
4. finiteness: if we trace out the instructions of an algorithm, then for all cases the algorithm will terminate after a finite number of steps; ^45e148
5. effectiveness: every instruction must be sufficiently basic that it can in principle be carried out by a person using only pencil and paper. It is not enough that each operation be definite as in [[Algorithm#^45e148]], but it must also be feasible.

A major difference between a [[Program]] and [[Algorithm]] is that the [[Program]] does not follow (4) in the criteria. But here a Program loops until more jobs are entered.(unless system crashes occur)

A flowchart is not an algorithm at all as it may be recursive

Computer Science can be defined as the study of date, its representation and transformation by a digital computer.
