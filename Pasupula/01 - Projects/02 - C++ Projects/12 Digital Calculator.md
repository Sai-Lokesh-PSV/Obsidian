The most effortless C++ project to get started with is a calculator. This project is particularly GUI-driven, making it easy to execute. This project will be a menu-driven program in which the outputs will be given by the user. It assists to strengthen some of the fundamental concepts of C++, particularly relating data types and decision-making statements.

The project requires validation for the inputs so that the calculation only takes place if the inserted data is numerical by nature. Furthermore, thereâ€™s some concept of data handling of a particular size. The larger the number, the larger the data type required to handle it. Tackling it properly will also need some skills that will go a long way in enabling one to secure an internship/job in the future.
