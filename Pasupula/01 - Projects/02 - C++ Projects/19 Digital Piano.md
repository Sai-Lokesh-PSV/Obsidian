The project idea is to design a GUI-based project where you can play a virtual piano to your heart’s content. This project may look easy, but a lot of concepts are applied which are quite complex. Incorporation of asynchronous functions along with dealing with the different audio libraries will take some time. Asynchronous code also enables to clear one’s concepts about multithreading, an essential concept in today’s programming world. This project helps to strengthen one’s resume beyond belief. To make it more interesting, try to create a function that records the tunes played on the piano. This rigorously puts the understanding of audio functions acquired from creating the project to the test, at the same time needs file handling to dump the recordings to the hard disk. This project will make you stand apart.
