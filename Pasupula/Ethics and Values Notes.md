# Addiction Overview
Addiction is characterized by three main elements, often referred to as the three Cs:

***Compulsive Use***: This refers to an irresistible impulse to use a substance, marked by repetitive and intrusive thoughts.

***Loss or Lack of Control***: The inability to limit or resist urges. Once addiction starts, it is difficult to stop without external help.

***Continued Use Despite Adversities***: Individuals continue using the substance despite the negative consequences. These may include declining health (e.g., liver impairment from alcohol), embarrassment, and legal or financial problems.

## Terminology Shift
- The term addiction was formally replaced by substance dependence in 1964 by the World Health Organization's Expert Committee on Drug Abuse.
- Substance dependence is classified into:
	- Psychological Dependence: Impaired control over drug use.
	- Physical Dependence: The development of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms due to the bodyâ€™s adaptation to the drug.

## Causes of Addiction
Environment: Family beliefs, attitudes, and peer pressure can contribute to initial drug use.
Genetics: Genetic traits can influence the progression into addiction, either delaying or accelerating it.
Brain Changes: Repeated drug use alters how the brain processes pleasure, causing physical changes in neurons.
Risk Factors for Addiction
Family History: Individuals with a family history of addiction are at a higher risk.

Mental Health Disorders: Conditions like depression, ADHD, or PTSD can increase susceptibility to addiction as drugs are often used as a coping mechanism.

Peer Pressure: Particularly relevant among young people, peer pressure plays a significant role in the initiation of drug use.

Lack of Family Involvement: A difficult family environment or poor parental supervision can increase the likelihood of addiction.

Early Drug Use: Using drugs at an early age can alter brain development and lead to a higher chance of addiction.

Highly Addictive Drugs: Some drugs, such as stimulants, cocaine, or opioids, are more likely to cause addiction, especially when smoked or injected.
