# Understanding Oscillations

## Day 1: Introduction to Oscillations

### Concepts:
- **Definition of Oscillation**: Repetitive back-and-forth motion around an equilibrium position.
- **Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)**: A type of oscillatory motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement.

### Key Formulae:
- Displacement: \($$$ x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi) $$\)
- Velocity: \( v(t) = -A \omega \sin(\omega t + \phi) \)
- Acceleration: \( a(t) = -A \omega^2 \cos(\omega t + \phi) \)
- Angular Frequency: \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), where \( k \) is the spring constant and \( m \) is the mass.

### Example Problem:
A mass of 0.5 kg is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 200 N/m. Find the angular frequency of oscillation.

**Solution:**
$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{200}{0.5}} = \sqrt{400} = 20 \text{ rad/s}
$$
### Summary:
- Oscillations are repetitive motions about an equilibrium point.
- SHM is characterized by a restoring force proportional to displacement.
- Angular frequency \( \omega \) determines the rate of oscillation.

## Day 2: Deriving Simple Harmonic Motion

### Concepts:
- **Hooke’s Law**: \( F = -kx \)
- **Equation of Motion**: Derive the differential equation for $$SHM: ( m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -kx )$$
- **Solution**: General solution is \( x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi) \)

### Key Formulae:
- Displacement: \( x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi) \)
- Angular Frequency: \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)

### Example Problem:
Derive the expression for the period \( T \) of a mass-spring system.

**Solution:**
\[
\text{For SHM, } T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
\]

### Summary:
- SHM is governed by Hooke’s Law and can be described by a differential equation.
- The period \( T \) is independent of amplitude and depends on mass and spring constant.

## Day 3: Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion

### Concepts:
- **Kinetic and Potential Energy**: 
  - Kinetic Energy: \( E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \)
  - Potential Energy: \( E_p = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \)
- **Total Energy**: Constant for SHM: \( E = E_k + E_p = \frac{1}{2} k A^2 \)

### Key Formulae:
- Total Energy: \( E = \frac{1}{2} k A^2 \)
- \( E_k = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 (A^2 - x^2) \)
- \( E_p = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \)

### Example Problem:
If the amplitude of a SHM is 0.2 m and the spring constant is 100 N/m, find the total energy of the system.

**Solution:**
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} k A^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times (0.2)^2 = 1 \text{ J}
\]

### Summary:
- Energy in SHM is the sum of kinetic and potential energies.
- Total energy is conserved and given by \( \frac{1}{2} k A^2 \).

---

## Day 4: Damped Oscillations

### Concepts:
- **Damping Force**: \( F_d = -b v \)
- **Damped Harmonic Motion**: Differential equation \( m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + b \frac{d x}{dt} + k x = 0 \)
- **Types of Damping**: Under-damped, critically damped, and over-damped.

### Key Formulae:
- Damped Angular Frequency: \( \omega_d = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m} - \left(\frac{b}{2m}\right)^2} \)

### Example Problem:
For a damping constant \( b = 0.5 \text{ Ns/m} \), spring constant \( k = 100 \text{ N/m} \), and mass \( m = 0.5 \text{ kg} \), find the damped angular frequency.

**Solution:**
\[
\omega_d = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m} - \left(\frac{b}{2m}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{100}{0.5} - \left(\frac{0.5}{2 \times 0.5}\right)^2} = \sqrt{200 - 0.25} \approx 14.1 \text{ rad/s}
\]

### Summary:
- Damping reduces the amplitude of oscillation over time.
- Damped frequency is lower than the natural frequency and depends on damping constant.

## Day 5: Forced Oscillations and Resonance

### Concepts:
- **Forced Oscillations**: Oscillations driven by an external periodic force.
- **Resonance**: Occurs when the driving frequency matches the system's natural frequency.

### Key Formulae:
- Resonant Frequency: \( \omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)
- Amplitude at Resonance: \( A = \frac{F_0 / m}{\sqrt{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + (\frac{b \omega}{m})^2}} \)

### Example Problem:
If a mass-spring system with \( m = 1 \text{ kg} \), \( k = 50 \text{ N/m} \), and \( b = 0.2 \text{ Ns/m} \) is driven by an external force \( F(t) = F_0 \cos(\omega t) \), find the amplitude of oscillation at resonance.

**Solution:**
At resonance, \( \omega = \omega_0 \):
\[
A = \frac{F_0 / m}{\frac{b \omega}{m}} = \frac{F_0}{b \omega} = \frac{F_0}{0.2 \times \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}}
\]

### Summary:
- Forced oscillations are influenced by an external periodic force.
- Resonance leads to maximum amplitude when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency.

## Day 6: Advanced Topics in Oscillations

### Concepts:
- **Coupled Oscillations**: Two or more oscillators interacting with each other.
- **Normal Modes**: Patterns of oscillation where all parts oscillate with the same frequency.

### Key Formulae:
- Coupled Oscillators: \( m_1 \frac{d^2 x_1}{dt^2} = -k(x_1 - x_2) \)
- Normal Modes: Solve the eigenvalue problem for the system matrix.

### Example Problem:
Two masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are coupled by springs with spring constants \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \). Find the normal modes.

**Solution:**
Form the matrix of the system and solve the eigenvalue problem to find the normal frequencies.

### Summary:
- Coupled oscillations involve interactions between multiple oscillators.
- Normal modes are the characteristic patterns of oscillation in such systems.
