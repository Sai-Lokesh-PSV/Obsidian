These days i feel so detached from everything i grew up with and also all the things i care about, it is quiet uncommon for me to do this as i really value relationships so much, but this kind of new advancement in life is really something that threw me off my head. Why does it actually happen, ins it because of Instagram, porn, loneliness, new place change, or an another factor that i havenâ€™t considered...

I believe that i was born and brought up really well due to the overwhelming amount of care and love my parents put in me, but it seems that either they or I am slowly drifting away from one and another. Which really makes no sense because they are loving and caring all the way through, am I not really up to expectations or is it i am disappointing them in ways that are known to me. It is extremely puzzling, and also something very hard to digest
