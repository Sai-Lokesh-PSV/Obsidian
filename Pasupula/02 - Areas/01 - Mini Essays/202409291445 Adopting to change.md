I had this feeling at the back of my mind that, change is constant and it is very easy for change to manifest and adopt. Boy I was wrong! I only theorized but have not implemented, it humbles me to an extent that i must change the way i have looked at things. My approach usually would be that i would theorize that ‘it would be like this that.....’ in the end only when one experiences that particular emotion or activity only then does he have the information to express.

watch when i said that information to express and not ‘the right’, I value the right of the person but equally I value his perspective and no two perspectives can be measured equally by any means existed to man. 

Change is always a funny thing, it might completely throw you off the chair of life you are sitting or just raise the chair of life the an another level, this does not depend on the persons leanings or skill set but truly to the adaptability of that person.
