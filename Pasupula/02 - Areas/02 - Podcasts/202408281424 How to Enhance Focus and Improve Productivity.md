# About Phones
Dr Cal says that he does not use a social media app that distracts him, instead he often used text messages and draws the inspiration from the [[First Apple Keynote 07']] when [[Steve Jobs]] introduces the phone with many features(minus the social media part).
There are certain disadvantages with not using a phone very much but it often goes underrated because when we do not use a phone we tend to have a text-bankruptcy.  He highlights a important point of not having a computer or a laptop in the library, provided that the books he is surrounded are carefully curated by him. In case he requires to make a note he pulls up a laptop but not a phone. [[Visual Science]] is brought up by Dr. Huberman for the difference between [[Linear thinking]] and [[non-linear thinking]] and when one is in the [[non-linear thinking]] state of mind the [[DPO]](Duration Path Outcome) and during this time the brain tends to spark creativity. The examples given are looking at the fireplace, looking at the ocean waves, and walking(?). But Dr. Cal says that majority of his thinking emerges from the walking sessions he has, to think of things like math derivation, ideas and so on.
The way this is classified by Dr. Huberman is that there are extreme is that define the state of mind for productivity are :
- During motion but we do not specify the trajectory of the thought.
- Body still, and mind very active.
Dr. Cal talks about productive meditation(deep work) and during walking we focus out central attention to the problem at hand.
